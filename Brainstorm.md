## What we've got

1. Hotline Miami-esque shoot-em-up
2. Explore stages of grief
3. Godot
---
## Characters
1. MC: Main Character <br/>
   - give that mf a gun.
   - shoot everything that moves
2. SC: Secondary Character <br/>
   - is the MC's lover/parent/sibling/something of that ilk (I'm leaning towards some kind of spouse cuz that explains why MC is alone in the house)
   - Died in a car accident the week before the game's events
3. Enemy Type Denial <br/>
   - Some kind of robber? Basically an intruder of some kind that the MC has to fight off
   - Has a baseball bat
   - MC can tank 2 hits (would this be too ez? Idk)
4. Enemy Type Anger <br/>
5. Enemy Type Bargaining <br/>
6. Enemy Type Depression <br/>
   - IS the MC but wearing different clothes
   - Uses the same gun that MC is using
   - heavy handed internal battle metaphor
7. Boss Acceptance <br/>
   - Is the SC
   - Only character able to tank multiple shots
   - Has movement patterns/abilities from the previous levels
   - For the first phase, the MC doesn't shoot back because they don't want to hurt their beloved. Then they get goaded into it by a between-phase dialogue.
   - Killing SC triggers endgame, which returns the MC to their room, and this time when they interact with the picture, they trigger end cutscene.

## The story thus far
### Intro and Denial Stage
- MC wakes up in their room. They explore the room.
- They need to interact with a picture of MC and SC on the bedstand. (see Room Decor)
- This triggers rustling behind the door.
- MC grabs a gun from the safe and goes outside into rest of house.
- Kill shit "Gotta clear these out before SC comes home
- unique mechanic is that you gotta finish the stage on a timer else you lose
- Cutscene where mc sees a message saying that SC is going to be home late.
- "It's hard to see in all this rain," says the message. It's not raining in the game.
- This message is outdated, from the night that SC died.
- "And then I woke up."

### Anger Stage
- MC wakes up in their room.
- It's identical except for one extra picture.
- Interacting with the picture triggers sound behind door.
